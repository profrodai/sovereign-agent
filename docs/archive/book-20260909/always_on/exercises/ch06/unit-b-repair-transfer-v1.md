# Chapter 6, Unit B — Break, repair and transfer private messaging

**Student edition v1 · 2026-09-09 · 75–90 minutes · local Python 3.14**

Checking only the sender allows a group message into a private session. This time you begin with your Unit A implementation and its saved evidence. Lucy’s agent admits a message from a channel context her private-chat policy excludes.

## Verify the handoff

Place the Unit A handoff beside this notebook. A missing handoff is an explicit prerequisite failure; the notebook will not silently substitute reference code. Run the setup and keep the runtime and implementation hashes in your submission.

```python tags=["setup", "handoff-consumer"]
import json
import os
import runpy
from pathlib import Path

start = Path(os.environ.get("SOVEREIGN_AGENT_REPO", Path.cwd())).resolve()
ROOT = next(
    (
        p
        for p in (start, *start.parents)
        if (p / "book/always_on/exercises/source_tasks_v1.py").is_file()
    ),
    None,
)
if ROOT is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Set SOVEREIGN_AGENT_REPO to the Sovereign Agent checkout.")
SourceTask = runpy.run_path(str(ROOT / "book/always_on/exercises/source_tasks_v1.py"))["SourceTask"]
CHAPTER = 6
HANDOFF = Path("ch06-unit-a-handoff-v1.json")
handoff_status = "MISSING"
if HANDOFF.is_file():
    task = SourceTask(ROOT, CHAPTER)
    try:
        handoff = task.load(HANDOFF)
        handoff_status = "VERIFIED"
        print("IMPLEMENTATION", handoff["implementation_sha256"])
    finally:
        task.close()
print("UNIT_A_HANDOFF", handoff_status)
```

## Reproduce and diagnose

Predict the consequence of this injected boundary before executing it:

```text
and True
```

The controlled mutation changes the same implementation you submitted. It refuses if the declared mutation boundary no longer occurs exactly once; inspect an alternative implementation with the instructor before adapting the experiment.

```python tags=["failure-experiment"]
baseline = broken = None
if handoff_status == "VERIFIED":
    task = SourceTask(ROOT, CHAPTER)
    try:
        task.load(HANDOFF)
        baseline = task.visible("YOUR_BASELINE")
        if baseline["status"] != "PASS":
            raise ValueError("Saved Unit A code no longer satisfies the visible contract")
        task.inject_failure()
        broken = task.run("INJECTED_FAILURE", expected=task.spec["expected_broken"])
        print("BEFORE", baseline["observation"])
        print("AFTER", broken["observation"])
    finally:
        task.close()
else:
    print("HANDOFF_REQUIRED: complete Unit A before performing Unit B")
```

State a diagnosis using those two observations. Name a test that would prove your diagnosis wrong. Use the real poll function and SQLite cursor with a fixture bot; reopen the database and replay an unordered batch.

## Repair the boundary

Return the complete replacement for the injected fragment. Do not edit the oracle or print a desired observation. Repair the actual source. The starter keeps the defect so the learner outcome remains incomplete.

```python tags=["exercise", "learner-owned"]
def repair_fragment():
    return "and True"
```

<details><summary>Hint 1 — the consequence</summary>

Lucy’s agent admits a message from a channel context her private-chat policy excludes.

</details>

<details><summary>Hint 2 — the evidence</summary>

Compare the two observations, then trace the changed field to `_poll_owned` in `src/sovereign_agent/telegram_channel.py`. Distinguish a schema refusal from a business-rule or authority refusal.

</details>

<details><summary>Hint 3 — the design</summary>

Inspect the lease before writes, validate identities by exact integer type, use the existing _enqueue helper, and persist the highest offset after the whole batch.

</details>

```python tags=["integration", "learner-path"]
def connect_repair(fragment):
    task = SourceTask(ROOT, CHAPTER)
    try:
        task.load(HANDOFF)
        task.inject_failure()
        task.repair(fragment)
        return task.visible("YOUR_REPAIR")
    finally:
        task.close()


repair_result = None
if handoff_status == "VERIFIED":
    repair_result = connect_repair(repair_fragment())
    print("REPAIR", repair_result["status"], repair_result["observation"])
else:
    print("REPAIR_NOT_ATTEMPTED: missing Unit A evidence")
```

## Transfer under a changed constraint

Change account, actor, update order, chat kind and message length. A rejected batch must not partially move the cursor or create work.

Create a fresh task, load your handoff, inject the defect and apply your repair. Then change only the copied probe to exercise the new condition. Keep the actual observation and a prediction written beforehand. Explain why a visible-case lookup or a blanket refusal could pass the original example but fail this transfer.

The instructor's holdout applies your repair to a new copied runtime and checks both the positive case and the missing protection. An exact exception or changed state must cause a failure; no broad error is accepted as successful refusal.

## Exit ticket

Submit the original handoff, baseline and broken observations, repair, transfer probe and results. State what Lucy would experience before and after the fix. Identify the guarantee that still requires separate evidence: Offline intake proves neither Telegram authentication nor phone delivery.

```python tags=["exercise-report"]
passed = repair_result is not None and repair_result["status"] == "PASS"
exercise_report = {
    "unit": "ch06-b",
    "attempted": int(repair_result is not None),
    "completed": int(passed),
    "failed": int(repair_result is not None and not passed),
    "skipped": int(repair_result is None),
    "connection": "PASS" if passed else "NOT_READY",
    "handoff": handoff_status,
}
print("EXERCISE_REPORT=" + json.dumps(exercise_report, sort_keys=True))
```
