# Chapter 11, Unit A — Construct tool isolation

**Student edition v1 · 2026-09-09 · 90–120 minutes · local Python 3.14**

**Design question:** Registration is not permission?

Build dispatch from registry lookup through allowlist, strict arguments, write guard and bounded JSON result. Refuse before invoking an unauthorized handler and keep raw validation inputs out of errors.

You edit a complete function in a temporary copy of `src/sovereign_agent/tool_dispatch.py`. The real callers, database and tool boundaries remain connected. Run from the locked Sovereign Agent development environment. The notebook runs reviewed local subprocesses; it is not a security sandbox. No live account is required.

## Predict before running

Install the method in the real Dispatcher and observe handler invocation counters, not just returned text.

Write the expected result and a falsifying observation before running. Include one legal action, one refusal, and the exact-empty case where the interface permits it. Explain the consequence for Lucy if your prediction is wrong.

```python tags=["setup"]
import json
import os
import runpy
from pathlib import Path

start = Path(os.environ.get("SOVEREIGN_AGENT_REPO", Path.cwd())).resolve()
ROOT = next(
    (
        p
        for p in (start, *start.parents)
        if (p / "book/always_on/exercises/source_tasks_v1.py").is_file()
    ),
    None,
)
if ROOT is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Set SOVEREIGN_AGENT_REPO to the Sovereign Agent checkout.")
SourceTask = runpy.run_path(str(ROOT / "book/always_on/exercises/source_tasks_v1.py"))["SourceTask"]
CHAPTER = 11
HANDOFF = Path("ch11-unit-a-handoff-v1.json")
```

## Construct the complete mechanism

Implement `invoke` in the string below. Keep the named signature and existing helper interfaces. The starter is intentionally incomplete; its failed connection is reported separately from whether the notebook itself executed. A constant answer cannot stand in for the real mechanism.

Read the chapter and the caller around the function in `src/sovereign_agent/tool_dispatch.py`. Draw the data path from the observed output through this function to its actual input or query. Then write your implementation from the contract.

```python tags=["exercise", "learner-owned"]
implementation_source = """
def invoke(self, call: ToolCall) -> dict[str, Any]:
    raise NotImplementedError("Construct this chapter mechanism")
"""
```

<details><summary>Hint 1 — the design</summary>

A known tool can still be unavailable to this particular worker.

</details>

<details><summary>Hint 2 — the boundary</summary>

Inspect the parameters and the caller in `src/sovereign_agent/tool_dispatch.py`. Identify validation, durable state and the first externally observable effect. Preserve the existing surrounding helper contracts.

</details>

<details><summary>Hint 3 — the structure</summary>

Check membership before argument validation, require a guard for consequential tools, run it before the handler and enforce encoded output size.

</details>

## Connect to the cumulative runtime

The following installs your complete function into the copied runtime and executes the chapter probe against it. It saves your implementation and the observed connection for Unit B only after that connection succeeds.

```python tags=["integration", "handoff"]
def connect_build(source):
    task = SourceTask(ROOT, CHAPTER)
    try:
        task.install(source)
        result = task.visible()
        if result["status"] == "PASS":
            task.save(HANDOFF, result)
        return result
    finally:
        task.close()


build_result = connect_build(implementation_source)
print("CONNECTION", build_result["status"])
print("OBSERVATION", build_result["observation"])
```

## Challenge and transfer

Use an unseen tool name, a valid allowed read, a denied registered read, a consequential call and oversized output.

Use a fresh `SourceTask`, install your implementation and edit **only its copied probe** to run the changed input. Keep the expected result in your prediction notes, independent of your implementation. Call `task.run("MY_TRANSFER", expected=your_expected)` and close the task in `finally`. Retain both a valid and a refused case so rejecting everything cannot pass.

The instructor runs additional cases with different identities and boundaries against the real source. Passing the visible connection alone is not the transfer verdict. Do not put instructor solutions or holdouts into a student submission.

## Save and explain

After success, submit `ch11-unit-a-handoff-v1.json`, your source, prediction notes and changed-input observations. Unit B checks the chapter, runtime hash and exact implementation hash and re-executes your code.

Explain which input or state caused the output, which observation would refute the explanation and what remains outside the guarantee: Dispatcher admission is not OS or network containment; container execution remains a separate chapter experiment.

```python tags=["exercise-report"]
exercise_report = {
    "unit": "ch11-a",
    "attempted": 1,
    "completed": int(build_result["status"] == "PASS"),
    "failed": int(build_result["status"] != "PASS"),
    "skipped": 0,
    "connection": build_result["status"],
    "handoff": "WRITTEN" if build_result["status"] == "PASS" else "NOT_READY",
}
print("EXERCISE_REPORT=" + json.dumps(exercise_report, sort_keys=True))
```
